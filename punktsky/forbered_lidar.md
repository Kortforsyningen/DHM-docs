# Forbered Lidar

_Denne proces håndterer alle arbejder, som leder op til at styrelsen modtager data fra producent._

* Pre-mission
* Mission Management
* Flight checks


_Structure of data_

_Data to/from Aerodata is stored on a common accessible location (presently stored on the m-drive)_

_The sub-folders “FromSupplier” and “ToSupplier” works as inbox and outbox for all data delivered from/to the supplier. In this way it can always be seen when and what data has been delivered. All subfolders starts with a data in the iso format (YYYYMMDD) so the can be sorted by date._ 

_From here the data is later on copied to the relevant blocks_

 

## Pre-mission

Before the data acquisition mission can commence it is important to check that the mission plan made by the contractor will result in usable data. This check covers a number of different aspects, which result in the following list of things to be checked:

* Survey method

  Method: Manual procedure
  Description: It is checked that the mission has been planned using LiDAR equipment matching the contract
  
* Collection Area

  Method: Manual Procedure
  Description: It is checked that the planned mission covers the entire area. Strips are transformed into swath-polygons that are checked against the tiles delivered to the contractor
