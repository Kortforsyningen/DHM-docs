_Structure of data

Data to/from Aerodata is stored on a common accessible location (presently stored on the m-drive)

The sub-folders “FromSupplier” and “ToSupplier” works as inbox and outbox for all data delivered from/to the supplier. In this way it can always be seen when and what data has been delivered. All subfolders starts with a data in the iso format (YYYYMMDD) so the can be sorted by date. 

From here the data is later on copied to the relevant blocks_
